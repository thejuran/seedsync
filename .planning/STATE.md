**Success Criteria:**
1. User clicks file options button and dropdown appears below/above button (flip behavior when near viewport edge)
2. User can see dropdown content without horizontal scrollbars or clipping
3. Dropdown closes when user clicks outside or selects an option
4. No `%dropdown` or `%toggle` SCSS placeholders exist in codebase
