## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

**From 01-01 (Bootstrap SCSS Setup):**
- Two-layer Bootstrap customization: variables (pre-compilation) + overrides (post-compilation)
- Use @import for Bootstrap (not migrated to @use yet)
- Chromium on ARM64, Chrome on AMD64 (Chrome not available for ARM64 Linux)

**From earlier planning:**
- Use teal (secondary) for all selections — Teal is more distinctive than blue, already used in bulk selection (Pending)
- Migrate to Bootstrap `btn` classes — Reduces custom CSS, leverages Bootstrap's states (Pending)
- Sessions 1-4 first, 5-6 later — Delivers biggest visual impact first (Pending)

### Pending Todos
