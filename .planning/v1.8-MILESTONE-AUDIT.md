# Milestone Audit: v1.8 Radarr + Webhooks

**Audited:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** passed
**Phases:** 26-28 (3 phases, 5 plans)

## Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Description | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------------|-------|--------|
| RAD-01 | Radarr connection config (URL, API key) | 26 | SATISFIED |
| RAD-02 | Radarr enable/disable toggle | 26 | SATISFIED |
| RAD-03 | Radarr test connection with result | 26 | SATISFIED |
| ARR-01 | Unified *arr Integration section | 26 | SATISFIED |
| ARR-02 | Independent subsections per *arr service | 26 | SATISFIED |
| HOOK-01 | POST /server/webhook/sonarr endpoint | 27 | SATISFIED |
| HOOK-02 | POST /server/webhook/radarr endpoint | 27 | SATISFIED |
| HOOK-03 | Webhook events trigger import pipeline | 27 | SATISFIED |
| HOOK-04 | Polling code removed (webhook-only) | 27 | SATISFIED |
| HOOK-05 | Webhook URL display in Settings UI | 27 | SATISFIED |
| TEST-01 | Fix 3 pre-existing test failures | 28 | SATISFIED |
| TEST-02 | All Angular unit tests pass (0 failures) | 28 | SATISFIED |

**Coverage:** 12/12 requirements satisfied (100%)

## Phase Completion

| Phase | Plans | Summaries | Verification | Status |
|-------|-------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| 26: Radarr Config & Shared *arr Settings UI | 2/2 | 2/2 | Self-check passed | Complete |
| 27: Webhook Import Detection | 2/2 | 2/2 | Full verification (6/6 truths) | Complete |
| 28: Fix Pre-existing Test Failures | 1/1 | 1/1 | 381/381 tests pass | Complete |

## Cross-Phase Integration

**Status:** All integration points wired correctly

| Integration Point | Status |
|-------------------|--------|
| Config.Radarr (P26) → auto-delete flow (P27) | CONNECTED |
| Shared *arr UI (P26) → Webhook URL display (P27) | CONNECTED |
| Webhook POST → enqueue → Controller → persist → badge → auto-delete | COMPLETE |
| Phase 26+27 changes → Phase 28 test health (381/381) | VERIFIED |

**Frontend-backend type alignment:** IRadarr interface matches Config.Radarr exactly.
**Dependency injection:** WebhookManager created in seedsync.py, shared by Controller and WebAppBuilder.
**No orphaned exports.** No missing connections. No broken E2E flows.

## Test Health

- **Angular:** 381/381 tests, 0 failures
- **Python (plan-relevant):** 38+ tests pass (config, webhook manager, webhook handler, auto-delete)
- **New tests added:** 23 (10 WebhookManager + 13 WebhookHandler)

## Tech Debt (Cosmetic)

Two minor cosmetic text issues found — not functional, not blocking:

1. **Toast message hardcodes "Sonarr":** `file-list.component.ts:139` says "Sonarr imported:" for all imports including Radarr. The badge correctly says "Imported" (source-agnostic). Cosmetic only.

2. **Auto-delete description mentions only Sonarr:** `options-list.ts:195,207` says "after Sonarr import" — should say "*arr import" or "Sonarr/Radarr import". Cosmetic only.

## Deviations

Zero deviations across all 5 plans. All plans executed exactly as written.

## Verdict

**PASSED** — All 12 requirements satisfied, all integration points wired, all tests passing, no functional gaps. Two cosmetic text items noted as tech debt for future cleanup.
