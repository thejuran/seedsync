# Requirements: SeedSync v1.8 Radarr Integration + Webhooks (Archived)

**Defined:** 2026-02-11
**Shipped:** 2026-02-11

## v1.8 Requirements

### Radarr Connection

- [x] **RAD-01**: User can configure Radarr connection (URL, API key) in Settings
- [x] **RAD-02**: User can enable/disable Radarr integration via toggle
- [x] **RAD-03**: User can test Radarr connection and see success/failure result

### Shared *arr UI

- [x] **ARR-01**: Sonarr and Radarr settings share a unified *arr Integration section with subsections
- [x] **ARR-02**: Each *arr subsection has independent enable/disable toggle, URL, API key, and test connection

### Webhook Import Detection

- [x] **HOOK-01**: POST webhook endpoint for Sonarr import events (`/server/webhook/sonarr`)
- [x] **HOOK-02**: POST webhook endpoint for Radarr import events (`/server/webhook/radarr`)
- [x] **HOOK-03**: Webhook events trigger import detection (same flow as current polling)
- [x] **HOOK-04**: Polling-based import detection removed (webhook-only)
- [x] **HOOK-05**: Settings UI displays webhook URLs for user to configure in Sonarr/Radarr

### Test Fixes

- [x] **TEST-01**: Fix 3 pre-existing failures in model-file.service.spec.ts
- [x] **TEST-02**: All Angular unit tests pass (0 failures)

| HOOK-05 | Phase 27 | Satisfied |
| TEST-01 | Phase 28 | Satisfied |
| TEST-02 | Phase 28 | Satisfied |

**Coverage:** 12/12 requirements satisfied (100%)

## Future Requirements (Deferred)

- **SAFE-02**: Manual import check button to force status refresh for selected file
- **SAFE-03**: Import path verification warning if *arr paths don't overlap with SeedSync local path
- **DARK-01**: Dark mode toggle feature

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Manage Sonarr/Radarr queues from SeedSync | Scope creep |
| Lidarr/Readarr support | Same pattern, wait until Radarr proves abstraction |
| Webhook authentication (API key/secret) | SeedSync typically runs on same LAN |
| Polling fallback alongside webhooks | Webhook-only; simpler architecture |
