# Requirements: v1.6 CI Cleanup (Archived)

*Milestone shipped: 2026-02-10*

## Workflow Consolidation

- [x] **WKFL-01**: `:dev` Docker image published to GHCR on every master push (multi-arch: amd64 + arm64) — *Phase 20*
- [x] **WKFL-02**: `docker-publish.yml` removed — single CI workflow handles everything — *Phase 20*
- [x] **WKFL-03**: Version tag publishing (`:X.Y.Z`, `:latest`) continues working on tag pushes — *Phase 20*

## Test Warnings

- [x] **WARN-01**: pytest cache warnings suppressed in Docker test runner output — *Phase 21*
- [x] **WARN-02**: webob cgi deprecation warnings filtered from pytest output — *Phase 21*

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| CI coverage gates (fail_under in CI) | GitHub Actions changes beyond consolidation |
| E2E test improvements | Separate concern, not CI cleanup |
| Angular test runner changes | Frontend, not backend CI |
| Dark mode toggle | Feature work, not CI |

## Success Criteria — All Met

1. [x] `:dev` image published on master push after e2e tests pass (multi-arch)
2. [x] Version tag publishing continues working (`:X.Y.Z` + `:latest`)
3. [x] Only `master.yml` handles Docker publishing (docker-publish.yml deleted)
4. [x] pytest output shows zero cache warnings
5. [x] pytest output shows zero webob cgi deprecation warnings
6. [x] All tests pass with no behavioral changes
