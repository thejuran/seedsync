# v1.8 Radarr + Webhooks - Archived Roadmap

**Shipped:** 2026-02-11
**Phases:** 26-28 (3 phases, 5 plans)

## Milestone Goal

Add Radarr support alongside Sonarr, replace polling with webhook-based import detection, and fix pre-existing test failures.

## Phase Details

### Phase 26: Radarr Config & Shared *arr Settings UI
**Goal**: User can configure both Sonarr and Radarr in a unified *arr Integration section
**Depends on**: Phase 25 (v1.7 complete)
**Requirements**: RAD-01, RAD-02, RAD-03, ARR-01, ARR-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can enter Radarr URL and API key in Settings page
  2. User can enable/disable Radarr integration via toggle
  3. User can click "Test Connection" for Radarr and see success/failure
  4. Sonarr and Radarr share a unified *arr Integration section with subsections
  5. Radarr configuration persists across app restarts
  6. Existing Sonarr settings continue working unchanged
**Plans**: 2

Plans:
- [x] 26-01: Backend Config.Radarr InnerConfig + test connection endpoint
- [x] 26-02: Frontend shared *arr Integration UI with Sonarr + Radarr subsections

### Phase 27: Webhook Import Detection
**Goal**: Webhook endpoints replace polling for both Sonarr and Radarr import detection
**Depends on**: Phase 26
**Requirements**: HOOK-01, HOOK-02, HOOK-03, HOOK-04, HOOK-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. POST /server/webhook/sonarr receives Sonarr import events and triggers detection
  2. POST /server/webhook/radarr receives Radarr import events and triggers detection
  3. Webhook events flow through same import pipeline (persist, badge, toast, auto-delete)
  4. SonarrManager polling code removed (webhook-only architecture)
  5. Settings UI displays webhook URLs for user to configure in Sonarr/Radarr
  6. Webhook endpoint returns 200 for valid events (Sonarr/Radarr retry on failure)
**Plans**: 2

Plans:
- [x] 27-01: WebhookManager + POST handlers + Controller integration (replace SonarrManager)
- [x] 27-02: Webhook URL display in Settings UI + unit tests

### Phase 28: Fix Pre-existing Test Failures
**Goal**: All Angular unit tests passing with zero failures
**Depends on**: Phase 26 (independent of 27, but ordered last)
**Requirements**: TEST-01, TEST-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. All 3 pre-existing failures in model-file.service.spec.ts fixed
  2. All Angular unit tests pass (381+ tests, 0 failures)
  3. No regressions in other test files
**Plans**: 1

Plans:
- [x] 28-01: Verify model-file.service.spec.ts fixes and confirm all tests passing
