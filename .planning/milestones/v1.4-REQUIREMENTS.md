# Requirements Archive: v1.4 Sass @use Migration

*Shipped: 2026-02-08*

## Must Have

- [x] **REQ-01**: Transform `_common.scss` from `@import` to `@forward` aggregation module
- [x] **REQ-02**: Transform `_bootstrap-overrides.scss` from `@import` to `@use` with namespaces
- [x] **REQ-03**: Update `styles.scss` to use `@use` for application modules (keep `@import` for Bootstrap)
- [x] **REQ-04**: Zero deprecation warnings from application SCSS code
- [x] **REQ-05**: All 381 Angular unit tests continue passing
- [x] **REQ-06**: Zero visual regressions (identical compiled CSS output)
- [x] **REQ-07**: All 14 component files continue working with modernized `_common.scss`

## Should Have

- [x] **REQ-08**: Document hybrid approach decision (Bootstrap stays on @import)
- [x] **REQ-09**: Validate sass-migrator compatibility (dry-run on component files) — documented as manual migration; sass-migrator cannot resolve Bootstrap internal paths

## Out of Scope

- Migrating Bootstrap to @use (blocked until Bootstrap 6)
- Migrating Font Awesome to @use (legacy package, not modular)
- Explicit namespaces in component files (keep `as *` for minimal changes)
- Adding new SCSS features or refactoring beyond @import to @use

## Outcome

All 9 requirements satisfied. 3 SCSS files modified across 3 phases. Zero visual regressions, all 381 tests passing.
