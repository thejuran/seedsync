# Requirements: DVC Dashboard

**Defined:** 2026-02-10
**Core Value:** For any future date, clearly show available points across all contracts and what resorts/rooms those points can actually book.

## v1.1 Requirements

Requirements for v1.1 "Share & Plan" milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Docker Packaging

- [x] **DOCK-01**: User can start the app with `docker compose up` on any machine with Docker
- [x] **DOCK-02**: User's data (database, point charts) persists across container restarts and rebuilds
- [x] **DOCK-03**: User can configure app settings (port, CORS, database path) via `.env` file
- [x] **DOCK-04**: Database migrations run automatically on container startup
- [x] **DOCK-05**: Pre-seeded 2026 point chart data ships in the image (works out of the box)
- [x] **DOCK-06**: FastAPI serves the React frontend (single container, single port)

### Booking Impact Preview

- [ ] **IMPT-01**: User can see before/after point balance per contract when previewing a booking
- [ ] **IMPT-02**: User can see nightly point breakdown for a proposed reservation
- [ ] **IMPT-03**: User sees a warning if proposed booking uses points that could still be banked
- [ ] **IMPT-04**: User can preview booking impact directly from Trip Explorer results

### What-If Scenario Playground

- [ ] **SCEN-01**: User can add multiple hypothetical reservations in a scenario workspace
- [ ] **SCEN-02**: User can see cumulative point impact of all hypothetical bookings across contracts
- [ ] **SCEN-03**: User can compare scenario point balances against current reality (baseline vs scenario)
- [ ] **SCEN-04**: User can clear/reset a scenario to start fresh

### Booking Window Alerts

- [ ] **BKWN-01**: User can see when 11-month (home resort) booking window opens for any trip date
- [ ] **BKWN-02**: User can see when 7-month (any eligible resort) booking window opens for any trip date
- [ ] **BKWN-03**: User sees booking window open dates on Trip Explorer results
- [ ] **BKWN-04**: User sees upcoming booking window openings on the dashboard alerts

### Seasonal Cost Heatmap

- [ ] **HEAT-01**: User can view a full-year calendar heatmap with daily point costs color-coded by season tier
- [ ] **HEAT-02**: User can select resort and room type to view different cost patterns
- [ ] **HEAT-03**: User can distinguish weekday vs weekend costs in the heatmap
- [ ] **HEAT-04**: User can hover over any day to see details (date, season name, point cost)

### Configuration

- [x] **CONF-01**: User can configure borrowing policy (100% or 50%) as an app-wide setting

## Future Requirements

Deferred to v2+. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Scraping & Import

- **SCRP-01**: User can import contracts and point balances from DVC account
- **SCRP-02**: User can import existing reservations from DVC account
- **SCRP-03**: System can scrape current point chart data by resort/season

### Advanced Scenarios

- **SCEN-05**: User can save and name scenarios for later comparison
- **SCEN-06**: User can simulate banking points from current use year
- **SCEN-07**: User can model adding a hypothetical new contract
- **SCEN-08**: User can view a timeline visualization of point balances over 12-18 months

### Advanced Heatmap

- **HEAT-05**: User can overlay "affordable dates" based on current point balance
- **HEAT-06**: User can compare two resorts side-by-side
- **HEAT-07**: User can view total stay cost (N nights) instead of per-night cost

### Notifications

- **BKWN-05**: User receives browser notifications for upcoming booking windows
- **BKWN-06**: User can export booking window dates to calendar (iCal)

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Multi-user / authentication | Single-user personal tool, runs on local network |
| Real-time DVC room availability | No public API; this tracks YOUR points, not Disney's inventory |
| Automated booking | Violates Disney ToS; risks account suspension |
| Mobile native app | Web-first, accessible from any browser |
| Railway/cloud deployment | Docker for self-hosting; users deploy wherever they want |
| Email/SMS notifications | No auth infrastructure; in-app alerts sufficient |
| Auto-optimization ("best plan") | Too many subjective factors; show numbers, user decides |
| Multi-year scenario modeling | Complexity explosion with UY boundaries; limit to current + next UY |
