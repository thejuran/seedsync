# Milestone v1.2: UI Cleanup

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-04
**Phases:** 9
**Total Plans:** 1

## Overview

Cleanup milestone to remove obsolete UI elements that became redundant after virtual scrolling and sticky action bar changes in v1.1.

## Phases

### Phase 9: Remove Obsolete Buttons

**Goal**: Remove Details and Pin buttons that are no longer functional
**Depends on**: Phase 8 (Final Polish)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:

- [x] 09-01: Remove obsolete Details and Pin buttons

**Details:**

The file options bar contained two buttons that became obsolete:
1. **Details button** - Toggled file timestamp details, but this is incompatible with fixed-height virtual scroll rows
2. **Pin button** - Made filters sticky when scrolling, but this is unnecessary since the actions bar is always visible

Both buttons and all associated state (showDetails, pinFilter) were cleanly removed from:
- Template (HTML)
- Component logic (TypeScript)
- Styles (SCSS)
- Service layer (ViewFileOptions)
- Test fixtures

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Decision: Remove Details button (Rationale: Incompatible with fixed-height virtual scroll rows)

- Decision: File options bar always static (Rationale: No need for sticky positioning without Pin feature)

**Issues Resolved:**

- Cleaned up UI with non-functional buttons
- Simplified file options bar to only functional controls

**Issues Deferred:**

- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- None (this was a cleanup milestone)
