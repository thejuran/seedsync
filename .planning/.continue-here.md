<current_state>
v2.0 Dark Mode & Polish milestone is complete. All 32 phases, 51 plans shipped.
Milestone archival (MILESTONES.md, PROJECT.md, STATE.md, ROADMAP.md) is done and committed.
The v2.0 git tag exists on remote but points to an older commit (73f647c) before two CI fixes.

CI was failing due to pre-existing v1.8 issue: integration tests missing `webhook_manager` arg.
Two fix commits pushed:
- 5975b9f: fix Controller integration tests (test_controller.py)
- b66401c: fix WebAppBuilder web integration tests (test_web_app.py)

CI run 21955945690 is in progress — Python + Angular unit tests PASSED, E2E tests running.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Phase 32 executed (32-01-PLAN.md: *arr text updates + WAITING_FOR_IMPORT enum)
- Phase 32 verified (3/3 must-haves passed)
- v2.0 milestone archived (MILESTONES.md, milestones/v2.0-ROADMAP.md, milestones/v2.0-REQUIREMENTS.md)
- PROJECT.md evolved (v2.0 requirements validated, key decisions added, status updated)
- STATE.md updated (between milestones)
- REQUIREMENTS.md deleted (archived)
- v2.0 tag created and pushed (but on wrong commit — needs moving)
- Two CI fix commits for integration tests (webhook_manager arg)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

1. Confirm CI run 21955945690 passes (E2E tests still running)
2. Move v2.0 tag to current HEAD (b66401c) — user wants tag on the CI-green commit
   - `git tag -d v2.0 && git tag -a v2.0 -m "..." && git push origin :refs/tags/v2.0 && git push origin v2.0`
   - OR create v2.0.1 instead (user hasn't decided yet)
3. New release process established: push first → UAT → tag only after UAT passes (saved to MEMORY.md)
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Release process change: push commits first, do UAT, then tag only after UAT passes. Tag = "it's good" signal.
- CI fix approach: pass real WebhookManager in controller integration tests, MagicMock() in web integration tests (since context is already mocked there)
- v2.0 tag placement: user wants to move tag to CI-green commit (pending decision on v2.0 move vs v2.0.1)
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- CI run 21955945690 must complete green before tag can be moved
- User needs to decide: move v2.0 tag or create v2.0.1
</blockers>

<context>
The v2.0 milestone itself is fully complete and archived. The only remaining work is operational:
getting CI green and placing the tag correctly. The two CI fixes are test-only changes (no
production code modified). After the tag is sorted, the project is ready for /gsd:new-milestone.
</context>

<next_action>
1. Check CI run 21955945690 status: `gh run view 21955945690`
2. If green, move the v2.0 tag (or create v2.0.1 per user preference)
3. Then: `/gsd:new-milestone` for next version
</next_action>
