# Requirements: UI Cleanup

**Defined:** 2026-02-04
**Core Value:** Consistent visual appearance across all pages while maintaining all existing functionality

## v1.2 Requirements

Remove obsolete UI elements made redundant by recent changes.

### Obsolete Elements

- [x] **CLEAN-01**: Remove Details button — no longer functional with fixed-height rows for virtual scroll
- [x] **CLEAN-02**: Remove Pin button — no longer functional since actions bar stays visible by default

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Adding new buttons | This milestone is removal-only |
| Changing remaining button behavior | Cleanup scope, not feature changes |
| Layout restructuring | Only removing obsolete elements |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| CLEAN-01 | Phase 9 | Complete |
| CLEAN-02 | Phase 9 | Complete |
