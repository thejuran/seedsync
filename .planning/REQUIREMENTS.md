# Requirements: SeedSync

**Defined:** 2026-02-11
**Core Value:** Reliable file sync from seedbox to local with automated media library integration

## v2.0 Requirements

Requirements for v2.0 Dark Mode & Polish. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Theme Infrastructure

- [ ] **THEME-01**: App supports dark theme via Bootstrap 5.3 `data-bs-theme` attribute
- [ ] **THEME-02**: App preserves current light theme as default
- [ ] **THEME-03**: App prevents flash of wrong theme on page load (inline script in `<head>`)
- [ ] **THEME-04**: App detects OS `prefers-color-scheme` preference and applies matching theme when set to "auto"
- [ ] **THEME-05**: App syncs theme preference across browser tabs via `storage` event
- [ ] **THEME-06**: App persists user's theme choice in localStorage

### Theme UI

- [ ] **UI-01**: User can select theme mode (light/dark/auto) in Settings page Appearance section
- [ ] **UI-02**: Settings page shows current active theme mode

### Styling

- [ ] **STYLE-01**: All hardcoded hex colors in SCSS are replaced with theme-aware CSS variables
- [ ] **STYLE-02**: Form inputs are theme-aware (light background in light mode, dark in dark mode)
- [ ] **STYLE-03**: Teal accent colors have appropriate contrast in both light and dark themes
- [ ] **STYLE-04**: Existing `data-bs-theme="dark"` on dropdown menus respects global theme setting

### Cosmetic Fixes

- [ ] **COSM-01**: Toast notifications reference "Sonarr/Radarr" instead of just "Sonarr"
- [ ] **COSM-02**: Auto-delete description text references both Sonarr and Radarr
- [ ] **COSM-03**: WAITING_FOR_IMPORT enum value added to file status

## Future Requirements

### Additional *arr Support

- **ARR-01**: Lidarr integration following same *arr pattern
- **ARR-02**: Readarr integration following same *arr pattern

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Lidarr/Readarr integration | Separate milestone — different feature area |
| E2E tests (Playwright) | Separate concern |
| Bootstrap @import → @use migration | Blocked until Bootstrap 6 |
| Custom theme colors beyond teal | Not requested — keep existing palette |
| Print stylesheet | Low priority — web app not typically printed |

## Traceability
