  <name>Task 2: Visual QA walkthrough at desktop and tablet widths</name>
  <what-built>
Complete UI with Bootstrap dropdown migration (Phase 6) and form input standardization (Phase 7).
Key changes to verify:
- Dropdowns use Bootstrap native component with dark theme and fade animation
- Form inputs have teal focus rings and consistent dark theme styling
- Checkboxes show teal when checked
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Open http://localhost:4200 in your browser and verify the following checklist.
Use browser DevTools responsive mode (Cmd+Shift+M or F12 -> device toolbar) for tablet testing.

## Files Page (Deep Dive - Most Important)

**Desktop Width (default):**
1. [ ] File list header visible and properly styled
2. [ ] File rows have striped/alternate background
3. [ ] Hover a file row - should show light teal background
4. [ ] Click a file row - should show solid teal selection background
5. [ ] Click "Filter" dropdown button - menu opens below with dark blue background
6. [ ] Dropdown items highlight on hover (quick 100ms transition)
7. [ ] Dropdown menu fades in smoothly (150ms animation)
8. [ ] Click outside dropdown - it closes
9. [ ] Scroll the page with dropdown open - dropdown closes
10. [ ] Click search input - shows visible border, teal focus ring on focus
11. [ ] File actions bar appears when file is selected
12. [ ] Selection banner shows correct count when using checkboxes

**Tablet Width (768px via DevTools):**
13. [ ] Set DevTools to 768px width
14. [ ] All content fits without horizontal scrollbar
15. [ ] File list is readable
16. [ ] Dropdown still functions and positions correctly
17. [ ] Buttons are tappable size (not too small)

## Settings Page (Quick Scan)

18. [ ] Navigate to Settings
19. [ ] Text inputs have visible borders on dark background
20. [ ] Click into a text input - teal focus ring appears
21. [ ] Tab through form controls - focus indicator visible on each
22. [ ] Checkboxes show teal background when checked
23. [ ] Disabled inputs are visually distinct (grayed out, ~65% opacity)

## AutoQueue Page (Quick Scan)

24. [ ] Navigate to AutoQueue
25. [ ] Pattern list is readable
26. [ ] Add pattern input is styled consistently with Settings inputs
27. [ ] Enable/disable toggle works visually

## Logs Page (Quick Scan)

28. [ ] Navigate to Logs
29. [ ] Log entries are styled correctly
30. [ ] Warning/error levels have appropriate background colors (if present)

## About Page (Quick Scan)

31. [ ] Navigate to About
32. [ ] Version number displays correctly
33. [ ] Any links are styled and visually identifiable

## Overall

34. [ ] No horizontal scroll at tablet width on any page
35. [ ] "Better than before" - UI is consistent and cohesive
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>
Type "approved" if all items pass, OR describe specific issues found (include item numbers).
Example: "Issues: #5 dropdown background is wrong color, #22 checkboxes show blue not teal"
  </resume-signal>
</task>

- [ ] Files page passes all tablet-width checks
- [ ] Settings page passes quick scan
- [ ] AutoQueue page passes quick scan
- [ ] Logs page passes quick scan
- [ ] About page passes quick scan
- [ ] No horizontal scroll at 768px width on any page

<success_criteria>
1. User approves visual QA walkthrough (POLISH-02)
2. Responsive breakpoints verified at tablet width (POLISH-03)
3. No visual regressions identified OR all identified issues resolved
</success_criteria>
